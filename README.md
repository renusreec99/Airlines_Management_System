This main code is written entirely in python and requires python to run and execute. 
* Download the provided zip file to the local directory.
*  Download and Install MYSQL
*  Extract the downloaded project zip.
*  There are two SQL files note that chavachauhan.sql is our dump file and chauhanchava.sql is our script file. 
* Now install all the dependencies using the following command :
  * python -m pip (only if pip is not installed) 
* make sure you have prettytable and pymysql installed before you run the program!!
  * pip install prettytable
  * pip install pymysql
* Once all the dependencies are installed run the files <project-root>/chavachauhan.sql or <project-root>/chauhanchava.sql to create the database and the related procedures, triggers and functions and insert the data.
* You can also run the script in the SQL file in MYSQL workbench. Use chavachauhan.sql as the dump or the chauhanchava.sql as the main sql file and run it in the workbench before you start. Here you will find the ‘airport’ database.
* Then, run the app using the following command from the project root directory in the terminal : python3 app.py
* Follow the instruction from the prompts from there.
* You can also use Jupyter Notebook or PyCharm Professional to run our program.
